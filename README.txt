3D_Graphing.py:

This program takes in an input of a function of z such as cos(z) and plots z with respect to z's real parts!
It can handle anything from basic functions to more complex ones such as sin, cos etc!

2D_GRAPHING.py:

This program generates a graph based on an infinite complex line set at a fixed real value. The function is with respect to x, it cannot handle
any form of polar coordinates
